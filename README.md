## Hi 👋

I'm Hyunbin — a cybersecurity student focused on Linux systems, networking, and infrastructure security.

I analyse systems from low-level components to backend services, with particular interest in routing behaviour, packet-level debugging, and real-world failure modes.

Most projects here are infrastructure experiments and technical research. Academic coursework remains private.
