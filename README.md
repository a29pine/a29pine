## Hi 👋

I'm Hyunbin — a cybersecurity student focused on Linux systems, networking, and infrastructure security.

I build and analyse systems from low-level components to backend services and CLI tooling, with a particular interest in network behaviour, packet-level debugging, and real-world system failures.

Most of my work centres around understanding why systems misbehave under load, misconfiguration, or edge-case routing conditions.

This profile contains personal projects, infrastructure experiments, and technical research. Most academic coursework remains private.
